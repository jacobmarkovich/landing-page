## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the Udacity Classroom.


# Languages used:  HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

This project took forever for me and I felt I was behind the curve most of the way through it.  However, I did manage to get a working page that I believe meets all expectations.  Links were created via JavaScript in an unordered list, the links scroll slowly to the intended targets, the active class is attached to each section as it enters the viewport, and finally the sections that aren't active have the active class removed.
